# Eatsage

## Overview

Eatsage is an innovative food delivery application that integrates AI and Blockchain technology to enhance the user experience. This app utilizes AI agents dedicated to specific tasks, creating a seamless and efficient system for food ordering and delivery.

## How Does the App Work?

The Eatsage app features three AI agents:

1. _Customer Agent_
2. _Valet Agent_
3. _Restaurant Agent_

### Customer Agent

The Customer Agent's backend is responsible for sending trigger notifications to the Restaurant Agent when an order is placed. The frontend is a basic chat interface powered by gemini-pro.

### Restaurant Agent

The Restaurant Agent's backend sends trigger notifications to the Valet Agent when an order is accepted by the restaurant. The frontend displays a list of all available order requests.

### Valet Agent

The Valet Agent's frontend is a list view of all delivery options, allowing the valet to accept or decline orders.

### Additional Features

- The Customer Agent can find nearby restaurants using the device's location.
- Payments are processed through the Fetch Blockchain using the Almanac smart contract. Users must purchase 'FET' tokens, and payments are made automatically.
